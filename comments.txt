This looks like a strong start. Right now, I'm getting an error when I run your code that I think could be solved by using "raw_input" rather than "input" and by making sure that the user's input is always converted to a string. Look back at the example project I did a few weeks ago for an example of how to do this with user input. I think the next phase of this will be actually having the user interact with the to do list and have them check things off. So you might have some kind of check at the beginning of your while loop in order to give the user a chance to look at the to do list and check things off. Of course, get in touch if we need to look at this together.
